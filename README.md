In this project, let's build a **Match Game** by applying the concepts we have learned till now.
### Game Structure

The project is a timed matching game app that challenges users to match images with the correct category. It begins with a score of 0 and a 60-second countdown timer. Users click on category tabs to reveal thumbnails and click on thumbnails to match them with the displayed image. When a match is made, the score increases, and a new image is displayed. If a mismatch occurs, the game ends, and a Scorecard view is presented. Users can choose to play again, resetting the score, timer, and categories. The game also ends when the timer reaches 0 seconds. Overall, it's an engaging and interactive game focused on image matching and category selection.

<summary>Functionality to be added</summary>
<br/>

The app must have the following functionalities

- Initially,
  - Score should be `0` and time should be `60` sec
  - The image to be matched should have the src attribute value as the value of the key `imageUrl` from the first object in **imagesList** provided
  - The **Fruits** tab should be active and the thumbnails with **FRUIT** as their category should be displayed
- The timer should start running backwards from the `60` sec
- When a tab is clicked, then the thumbnails in the corresponding category should be displayed
- When a thumbnail is clicked, if that is matched with the image to be matched,
  - Score is incremented by one
  - The new image to be matched should be generated randomly among the value of the key `imageUrl` from **imagesList** provided
- When a thumbnail is clicked, if it is not matched with the image to be matched,
  - The game should end, and the [Scorecard](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/match-game-score-card-lg-output.png) view should be displayed
  - When **PLAY AGAIN** button is clicked, then we should be able to play the game again
    - The score and time values should be reset to `0` and `60` sec respectively
    - The image to be matched should reset to the value of the key `imageUrl` from the first object in **imagesList** provided
    - The active tab should reset to **Fruits**, and the thumbnails with **FRUIT** as their category should be displayed
- When the timer reached `0` sec, then the game should end, and the [Scorecard](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/match-game-score-card-lg-output.png) view should be displayed
- The App is provided with `tabsList`. It consists of a list of tabItem objects with the following properties in each tabItem object
